      <h2> Hey! I'm Klayton!</h2>
      <p>I live in beautiful Port Townsend on the Olympic Peninsula in the NW corner of Washington State.</p>
      
      <p>I'm really excited to be getting started with programming. Some things I'm really interested in are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>global communication ideas and human connectivity</li>
        <li>automated systems & AI</li>
        <li>private web development and freelance work</li>
        <li>networking with like-minded individuals world-wide</li>
      </ul>

    <article> <!-- about me -->
      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p>My wife and I have been married for 17 years and have 6 incredible kids, ages 4 to 15. Needless to say, my family is a huge part of my life. Especially with Covid-19, things are even more involved than ever. From education to recreation, everything has changed and finding ways to connect with my family is a big part of my life.</p>
      <p>Professionally, I've been a builder in the construction industry for the past 18 years and am looking to turn a new page and make a transition to a more tech-intensive life style. I feel that programming and software developement could be used in an incredible way in the building industry. </p>
      <p>Back in community college, I took some basic programming courses, but didn't really take it anywhere. After a plan to go into engineering at the University of Washington and then into aviation, I made a drastic direction change and went into construction.</p>
      <p>Currently, I work full-time through my construction company, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dauntlessconstructioninc" target="_blank"> Dauntless Construction Inc</a>, and am working to forward my computer career at the same time. </p>
      <p>When I have a few minutes of down-time, I'm generally found hanging out with my wife, Lindsey, and maybe trying to find a show like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249364/" target="_blank">Broadchurch</a> or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575968/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Hinterland</a>.<p>
      <p>Now I'm looking to change it up again. After many years of random work, I'm hoping to pin down some areas I want to focus on and build something powerful with a dynamic team. I don't know what it'll be yet, but I know there are a lot of opportunities out there.</p>
